# Evo-Tor
**Evo-Tor** is a [Wa-Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor) based population simulation, which was originally my study project for the university.  

Evo-Tor has few differences from the original simulator:  
- Besides Fish and Sharks, there is a new live species: **seaweed** (or simply **weed**). Unlike the other species, weed are not movable
and reproduce by appering next to another weed or randomly.
- Fish also feel hungry and may die by starve. They need to eat weed to survive and give offsprings.
- The user is not just a spectator, they have a playable Fish cell on the board. The player needs his Fish to survive as long as it can and earn the biggest score.
